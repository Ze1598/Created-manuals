# Created-manuals
This repo was created for me to upload Manuals I've created for different programming areas.
I've started with a Python 3 and an Unix Command Line Manuals, but in the future I want to create one for JavaScript \
and another for SQL.

Note: I will be updating these Manuals once in a while so it will take some time until each one is "finalized"
