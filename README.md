# Created-manuals
This repo was created for me to upload Manuals I've created for different programming areas.
I've started with a Python 3 (incomplete) and an Unix Command Line Manuals, but in the future I want to create one for JavaScript and another for SQL.

Future updates: trying to finish once and for all the Python 3 Manual before the end of January.
