# Created-manuals
This repo was created for me to upload Manuals I've created for different programming areas.
I've started with a Python 3 (incomplete) and an Unix Command Line Manuals, but in the future I want to create one for JavaScript and another for SQL.

Update log:

(jan. 28th 2018) Deleted the exisiting Python PDF and swapped it for the finished version, called Python3x_Manual.pdf. This means I'm done with the Manual for Python and no updates will be done to that file. Future Python-related topics I want to tackle will be created in separate documents.

(jan. 29th 2018) Added a Manual about Git.
