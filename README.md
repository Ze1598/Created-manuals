# Created-manuals
This repo was created for me to upload Manuals I've created for different programming areas.
I've started with a Python 3 (incomplete) and an Unix Command Line Manuals, but in the future I want to create one for JavaScript and another for SQL.

Update log:

(jan. 28th 2018) Deleted the exisiting Python pdf and swapped it for the finished version, called Python3x_Manual.pdf. This means I'm done with the Manual for Python and no updates will be done to that file. If there's other Python topics I create a manual for, I will create and upload those separately.
